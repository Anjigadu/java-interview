## Java interview

I created study notes for my recent interviews. I am sharing them here so that others can benefit from it. 
The notes are specifically for theory based Java interviews, typically done in service based companies 
(as opposed to coding based interviews done in product companies).  

### How to use it?

These are study notes, mostly for week/day before the interview revisions. Check resources on each topic 
for in-depth preparation.

**Note**: Pick and choose the topics based on the company you are interviewing. 
Each Company/Panel/Interviewee has their favorite topics, which can vary from JVM internals to high level system design. 
Topics also vary based on your experience and role you are applying for. 
Research other candidates' interview experiences at the company, or better yet, just ask the recruiter.

### Opinion based questions

Answers to such questions vary based on multiple factors (interviewer and interviewee's experience with Java, exposure to other languages, personal taste, etc). Thus, take the answers with pinch of salt, and make them your own before using them.
