## Java interview

I created study notes for my recent interviews. I am sharing them here so that others can benefit from it. 
The notes are specifically for non-coding Java interviews, typically done in service based companies.  


### How to use it?

Pick and choose the topics based on the company you are interviewing. 
Each Company/Panel/Interviewee has their favorite topics, which can vary from JVM internals to high level system design. 
Topics can also vary based on your experience and role you are applying for. 
Research for other candidates' interview experience at the company, or better yet, just ask the recruiter.

### Probable Questions

Answers of such questions vary based on multiple factors (interviewer and interviewee's experience with Java, exposure to other languages, personal taste, etc). Thus, take the answers with pinch of salt, and make them your own before using them.

- What do you like about Java?
- What do you not like about Java?
- Which is better - compilation, interpretation or JIT? Why?
